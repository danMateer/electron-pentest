A penetration test methodology to be used in conjunction with relevant [OWASP WSTG - v4.2](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/) on Electron desktop application assessments.

Based largely off of Luca Carettoni's [Electron Security Checklist: A guide for developers and auditors](https://doyensec.com/resources/us-17-Carettoni-Electronegativity-A-Study-Of-Electron-Security-wp.pdf)
