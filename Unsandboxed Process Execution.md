# Unsandboxed Process Execution

# [OWASP Desktop App Security Top 10 (2021) Risk](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-desktop-app-security-top-10/blob/main/tab_detaileddescription.md#owasp-top-10-desktop-application-security-risks-2021--detailed-description)
OWASP Top 10 2021 DA6: Security Misconfiguration

# Description
Occasionally there is a need for an Electron application to load untrusted content. In such cases the process execution should be limited to [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox). This limits the harm malicious code could cause by limiting access to most system resources â€” sandboxed processes can only freely use CPU cycles and memory. Sandboxed processes use dedicated communication channels to delegate tasks to more privileged processes.

# Instruction
If `nodeIntegration` is **false** or unspecified and preload is empty, `sandbox` should be enabled by default.

For `BrowserWindow`, sandboxing needs to be explicitly enabled:
```
mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
 ""webPreferences"": {
  ""sandbox"": true
  }
 });
```
