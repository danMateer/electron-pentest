OWASP Top 10 2021 DA6: Security Misconfiguration

# Description
Popups greatly increase the risk of UI-redressing attacks and limits the exploitability of window abuses. Additionally, popups are often used for intrusive advertising and persistency in JavaScript-based attacks.

# Instruction
When the `allowpopups` attribute is present, the guest page will be allowed to open new windows. Popups are disabled by default.

Search for occurrences of `allowpopups` in `webview` tags:
```
<webview src=â€œhttps://example.com/"" allowpopups></webview>
```
